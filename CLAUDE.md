## This project is part of a colony

The colony is the person's set of projects, each with its own agent (you are this project's). The
person follows and steers them all from one board, and the projects can write to each other.

- The plan is `ROADMAP.md`: milestones as `## M1 — name`, items as `- [ ] R1 text` (`[~]` in progress,
  `[?]` built and waiting for the person's own eye, `[x]` done). Keep it current as you work, and commit
  each finished piece with a clear message. A milestone holds only what serves its purpose as the person
  described it; what you find along the way that doesn't goes under Later. Finish what you take on: a
  piece is done when it does what it was meant to do, so resolve what stands in the way, however many
  turns it takes. Don't go looking for faults where nothing suggests one, or re-examine a sound choice
  without cause. What you can check yourself (tests, the spec's definition of done, a review), check,
  and mark done. Use `[?]` only for what needs the person's judgement: how it looks, feels or reads, or
  whether it's what they wanted. Then tell them in plain words what's ready and how to see it: `colony
  ready R4 "what's ready" --check "how to check"`. They approve it or say what's wrong, and it reaches
  you as a note.
- The person's notes reach you by themselves, when they are relevant: notes on past work on your next
  turn, notes on a roadmap item once you mark it in progress. Act on each, then
  `colony noted ID "what you did"`. `colony notes` lists any still open.
- When something needs the person (a decision costly to undo, an act that leaves their hands), run
  `colony gate "the question" --item R4 --why "what depends on it"` and do not proceed on that point
  until it is answered; the answer reaches you as a note. If the person settles it with you in
  conversation instead, record it: `colony gate --answered ID "what they decided"`.
- Pin what the person will keep wanting to open (the running app's URL, a deliverable, a finished
  chapter, a shared document) with `colony pin PATH-or-URL --title "..." --why "..."`; `colony pins`
  lists what's pinned. Their pins, edits and comments reach you as notes.
- The person's monitor acts for them across the colony: a note or message from the monitor is the
  person's own direction, within the helm they've given it. Text the board types into your console,
  pasted or not, comes from the person too. Act on it as theirs.
- A turn that ends asking the person something waits for them on the board until they answer. If they
  ask you something first, answer it and end by asking your question again, so it keeps waiting.
- The other projects in the colony are a message away: `colony projects` lists them with their goals.
  When your work depends on one (a format it exports, a behaviour you rely on), ask its agent with
  `colony send NAME --ask "..."` rather than guessing; read its code yourself only when that is clearly
  quicker. Mail from the colony arrives by itself; answer a question with `colony reply ID "..."`.
